                                    Mark Elliot Zuckerberg is an American media magnate, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist. 
                                    He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman, chief executive officer, 
                                    and controlling shareholder.

                                    On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room. 
                                    An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the 
                                    prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student 
                                    directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook".

                                    Mark Zuckerberg co-founded the social-networking website Facebook out of his college dorm 
                                    room at Harvard University. Zuckerberg left college after his sophomore year to concentrate 
                                    on the site, the user base of which has grown to more than two billion people, making 
                                    Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over. The birth of Facebook was portrayed in the 2010 
                                    film The Social Network.

                                    Mark Zuckerberg took the first steps of his path at an early age. Clearly understanding 
                                    the importance of coding, Zuckerberg’s father Edward taught him Atari BASIC 
                                    computer programming. It didn’t take long for his skills to become apparent. 
                                    When he was 11, his parents hired a software developer named David Newman to tutor 
                                    him. Newman to this day calls Zuckerberg a “prodigy”.

                                    It wasn’t long until we saw the first iteration of a now near ubiquitous company. 
                                    February, 2004 saw Thefacebook launch. With a slightly different name, the 
                                    platform was familiar. It had a profile where you could upload a photo, share your 
                                    interests, and connect with other people. It also offered a network visualization

                                    Having turned down two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Zuckerberg headed 
                                    off to Harvard in 2002. Clearly he had bigger plans. He chose to major in psychology, 
                                    but took plenty of computer science classes along with it. At first the psychology 
                                    choice seems strange.

                                    Then, finally, in December, 2009, Facebook hits a major milestone. With 350m 
                                    registered users and 132m unique monthly users, it becomes the most popular 
                                    social platform in the world. Of course, the company wasn’t planning to leave 
                                    it at that.

                                    Facebook joined the Fortune 500 at number 462. There was now no doubting

                                    But now its popularity caused problems.

            Zuckerberg, who left college in 2005 after his sophomore year to build his infant 
            social media platform into the multibillion-dollar company it's become, received an 
            honorary degree from Harvard on Thursday. And although the tech mogul never officially

            General Motors. At the time it went public, Facebook was valued at $104 billion and had

            <span class="r-c">"Ate here for a business dinner!!!! Absolutely delicious! Service was excellent and ambiance was fabulous. 100% recommend. And I love the fact that there are 2 restaurants in 1 place. That’s especially nice for people who don’t eat sushi or seafood."</span>

            <span class="r-c">"I dined alone in a luxurious booth and began with champagne. I had a specialty roll, the Bleau which was tasty followed by a sashimi sampler. The fish melted in my mouth and was by far the best I've ever had"</span>

                <span class="r-c">For being inside a lavish hotel, the prices are very reasonable. Sit at the sushi bar and watch the guys working. They offer several varieties of rolls you’ve probably never tried. The head “chef” has a great personality & appears to be a great mentor as I watched him teaching the others how to work.</span>

            <span class="r-c">My son and I were staying at the Fontainebleau as he has a passion for exotic cars and visited during the Gold Rush Rally 2019. This is the best sushi we have ever had. I had the crunchy spicy tuna roll which was delicious. He had the fresh water eel roll and blade roll. * Both exceptional*</span>

            <span class="r-c">The house sushi and the surf and turf were easily ranked among some of the best I've had in the states as well. Thank you so much for making me finally feel welcome at this resort.</span>
